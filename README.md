With Cloud Map, you can define custom names for your application resources, and it maintains the updated location of these dynamically changing resources. This increases your application availability because your web service always discovers the most up-to-date locations of its resources.                                                                                                                                                                                     |Orchestration & Management    |Coordination & Service Discovery     |false|                                                                    |            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                         |
